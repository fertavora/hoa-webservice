# HOA Web Service
This service is meant to be the backend app to support a HOA Management System.

# How to run it
## Development mode
Make sure there is a PostgreSQL database running and the `process.env.DB_NAME` database already exists.

Check the `template.env` files to set the local `.env` required to run the service.


Then run `yarn dev`.
